Creating objects that will handle the retrieval of the csv files to convert it into objects.  These are EmployeeDA and EmployeeDA objects.

INSTRUCTIONS:
The task requires implementing changes to the Java code without altering the composition of the domain objects, following correct naming conventions for variables and objects, utilizing HashMap as a solution, and using department.setDepTotalSalary() to aggregate values into the object.

Additionally, the approach should focus on using department.setDepTotalSalary() rather than accumulating salaries for printing the department total salary. The completed solution should be submitted via the provided GitHub solution link on NEUVLE.
